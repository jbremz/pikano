# KAN PINO

>**Update February 2025** 
>I started this project in May 2024 and it seems that this idea has been explored extensively in the literature since which is great ðŸ™‚ most notably I think [_Kolmogorov Arnold Informed neural network: A physics-informed deep learning framework for solving forward and inverse problems based on Kolmogorov Arnold Networks_](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11045) (June 2024) - please check out this and related if you'd like the rigorous analysis.

Some very simple notebooks playing around with the idea of physics-informed KANs.

The idea here is fairly straightforward: KANs seem like natural choices for modelling physical systems, why not integrate them into a neural operator + PINN framework?

I'll try some very simple experiments along these lines here.

## Experiments

### `01-basic-mlp-deeponet.ipynb`

Simple baseline to get going.

### `02-basic-kan-deeponet.ipynb`

Switching the MLP in the previous experiment for a KAN. This also means I can do away with the "sensors" framework and just input the raw parameters for the damped harmonic oscillator: `Î¶` and `Ï‰0`. This means the network only has 3 inputs (with the extra `y` coordinate).

Managed to get an order of magnitude lower error with the KAN as opposed to the MLP using only ~500 parameters as opposed to 80,000 that the MLP used ðŸ‘€.

### `03-PIKAN.ipynb`

Now trying to do away with the generated data and using a physic-informed loss instead. This will consist of a boundary condition loss $L_{BC}$ and a physics loss $L_{phys}$.

I will need to change the network so that it also has the boundary conditions as input this time.
